# Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) tutorial at Stratneuro 2024

In this tutorial we will introduce you to BIDS basics. It's meant for BIDS newbies, since a [survey prior to the event](/StratNeuro2024_intro.pdf) revealed your background.

First, we will give you a basic BIDS intro before then working on a BIDS basic conversion of a PET phantom data set. 
The [slides](https://osf.io/e3b2m) for the basic intro ar freely available on the Open Scinece Foundation's data sharing server. A special thanks to Ariel Rokem from the University of Washington for making them and hsaring them with the community for re-use.

Next, using the [provided Jupyter notebook](/PET_BIDS_tutorial_Colab.ipynb) in this folder and [Google Colab](https://collab.google.com/), you will download some phantom data in neuroimaging formats as they come of a scanner and then work on converting it to BIDS format. A special thnaks to BIDS maintainer Anthony Galassi for adding additional functionality to the notebook to make it run in any Colab. We will also introduce you to a BIDS convetrer that runs fully online, [EZBids](https://brainlife.io/ezbids/) that comes though with some restrictions for European data users. 

Finally, we will also spend time on how we cna utilize data in BIDS format for easy processing of neuroimaging data. We ill finish of the day by talking about machine learnign applications and how BIDS can be useful for them.
