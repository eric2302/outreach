### January 22th: BIDS Educational Day

This day is devoted to onboarding and training for researchers covering the basics of the BIDS standard, as well as more focused hands-on sessions in the afternoon. 

- **Morning Session: The BIDS Standard**
   - Terminology and Data Structure: source, raw, derivatives
   - Generic tools

- **Afternoon Session: Parallel tracks**
   - *PET-BIDS*: hands-on demonstrations of BIDS tooling for PET data
      - Data Curation: Tools for helping you more easily convert your data to BIDS.
      - BIDS Apps: How to get the most out of your BIDS datasets, with existing and upcoming tools.

   - *BIDS derivatives:* organizing and describing outputs of computations performed on brain imaging data
      - Electrophysiology derivatives
      - MRI derivatives


### January 23th - 24th

These days are devoted to projects, getting help with applying lessons learned during the BIDS educational day, or anything else you want, in total unconference style. 

- Public nEUro: sharing data in Europe, short presentation and discussion

- Unconference: project based hacking, see [Projects](#projects)

## Projects
- Head modelling and applications (extending FEM for MEG head models in [SimNIBS](https://simnibs.org), and integrating SimNIBS head models into [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools))
- Creating a preliminary BIDS App PET for kinetic modelling using both invasive and non-invasive models based on *kinfitr*
- BIDS Atlas PEB development, work on 23rd already and 24th from 2pm PM -- [jisti meeting](https://meet.jit.si/BIDS_connectivity_project_meeting) @PeerHerhol
